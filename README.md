# arXiv Paper Classifier

**AI-Powered Research Paper Categorization Platform**


## Overview

**arXiv Paper Classifier** is a full-stack web application that automatically classifies research papers into academic domains using **machine learning**.
Users submit a paper’s **title and abstract**, and the system predicts the most relevant research category with confidence scores.

The project integrates **modern frontend design**, **secure authentication**, **admin management**, and a **CatBoost machine learning model** into a single end-to-end system.


## Key Features

### Authentication & Security

* User signup and login
* Email verification for account activation
* Secure password hashing
* Role-based access (User / Admin)

### Machine Learning Classification

* CatBoost-based text classifier
* TF-IDF and domain-specific keyword features
* Confidence scores and top-5 predictions

### User Dashboard

* Submit paper title and abstract
* View predicted category with explanation
* Track past classification history

### Admin Panel

* View all registered users
* Monitor user activity and classifications
* Delete users securely (admin-only access)
